# Pricing Tiers Panel

This repository showcases a responsive **Pricing Tiers Panel** built with **HTML** and **CSS**. It’s designed for use in SaaS websites, landing pages, or any project offering subscription plans.

> **Note:** This project was built as a code-along exercise during a web development course. All code and layout were implemented by me while following the lessons.
